# Lecture 3: 

### What we learned so far:



### Relationships and Entities




### Database
- Made up of tables
- Each row in a table contains a set of values
- Each column has a descriptive name and a specific data type
- Example:
    - Table for a grocery store:
         - headers: {id, name, quantity, price}
         - Each row has an autogenerated id value which is unique to the t           able
         - Each value corresponds to its respective column name
         - Name has a type string, and columns quantity has type integer,            etc.

- What is the significance of a database? 
    - You can query data
    - Extremely helpful for larger databases
    - Db's tend to do its own indexing and optimization 
    - look up data faster
    - data will be structured
    - databases scale well
    - can relate data from two different tables together
    - JSONs tend to have issue of structure / whereas db's will always be
      structured

- What is a relational database?
    - Allows relationships between your data (ex: MySQL, Postgres SQL, etc      .)
    - If i have a user table, how do I show that user's are friends?
    - Two tables for a blog: 
        - User table (id, name, username)
        - Post table (id, text, author)
    - Relational because the author field uses a **foreign key**
        - Field that uniquely identifies a row in another table
    - One-to-one:
        - each entry has one unique id
        - us citizens to social security number
        - people to driver's license
    - One-to-many:
        - Row in table A can be related to many rows in table B, but row i          n table B can only be from one row in table A
    - Many-to-many:
        - Goes both ways:
            - actors to movies
           


- What is SQL?
    - Structured query language
    - Queries: 
        - question we can ask the database (how many posts were created by
          bob?)
    - Language of SQL has its own keywords and syntax
  

- Why do we need SQL?
    - We need a way to communicate with the database
 

- What is SQLite? 
    - SQlite is a relational management database management system (RDBMS)
    - Very light weight and easy to set up 
    - NO config  / server / installation
    - Different: stored in an ordinary disk file
    - SQL db is all contained in a single file

- Pros:
    - doesn't rely on a server to run
    - Nothing to configure
    - SQL lite is small library only 250 kb
    - filebase: extremely portable

- Cons:
    - Not all queries are scalable

- SQL Syntax:
    - How to create a db?
        - `sqlite3 <name>.db`
    - How to create a table?
        - `CREATE TABLE <name>(
            (column1name datatype)
        - types: integer, bigint, decimal, serial
        - character types: text
        - boolean, timestamp, date

    - example:
        ```{sqlite}
        CREATE TABLE USERS (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
        NAME TEXT NOT NULL,
        AGE INT NOT NULL,
        EMAIL CHAR(50)
        );
        ```

    - example:
        ```{sqlite}
        CREATE TABLE POSTS (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
        TEXT TEXT NOT NULL,
        AUTHOR INT NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (AUTHOR) REFERENCES USER(ID)
        );
        ```
    - example:
        inserting values into table
        ```{sqlite}
        INSERT INTO posts(text, author)
            VALUES ('My first post', 1);
        ```
    - reading data from database:
        ```{sqllite}
        SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
        SELECT <COLUMNS> FROM <table_name>;
        ```
    - How to select from data base with a condition:
        filtering data 
        ```{sqllite}
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >=18;
        SELECT * FROM posts WHERE author = 1 AND id = 1;
        ```

    - Update values:
        ```{sqlite}
        UPDATE users SET
            email = 'adjdhs@gmail.com'
            WHERE id = 1;
        ```
    - General reasoning behind a db:
        - Global variable for posts: []
            - Cons: lose data after killing the app
            - Solution: Create a json in txt or something (post.txt/post.j              son)
            - Cons: We have no guaruntee that it follows syntax
            - Solution: Use database

    - Understanding foreign keys:
        - Two different tables:
            - 1: {users, name, id}
            - 2: {posts, content, id, user_id}
            - We want to combine the two so that it relates
            - Author references the field id in table 1
            - `FOREIGN KEY (AUTHOR) REFERENCES USERS(ID)`
            - For 1-many -> you just need a foregin key to the many table
            - For one-to-one  you need to add a foregin key to one table t              oo
